Hyperalloy Scythe,1d8+1,,3,6,25,-,-,Str/Dex,1,2,Melee,"Some societies never really developed the sword as we know it and instead use something like a scythe. This is a scythe-weapon made with advanced metallurgical technology. The blade is stronger, more flexible and holds an edge better than a conventional steel tool. It is also immune to rust (but not to the rust-like effects of metal-eating viruses). This one is made specifically for combat, but it is also superb for reaping wheat.",,External

Greatswords are large and unwieldy, requiring two hands for use.",,Official
HyperIce Shortsword,1d8+3,,-,-,85,-,-,Str/Dex,1,4,Melee,"A short, stabbing focused blade, made from supercooled ice. It is as sharp as broken glass and leaves nothing but water traces in the victim's wounds. Virtually untraceable, hyperice blades are almost exclusively used as tools for assassination and are therefore difficult to buy in most organized societies.
A power cell keeps the blade frozen for 24 hours. Regrowing the blade is a longer and more involved process. It requires a supply of clean (preferably distilled) water and about thirty minutes to freeze a new blade.

A Type A power cell will fuel a stun baton for up to forty successful hits. The batons themselves are flexible and ineffective as bludgeons. A target brought to 0 hit points by a stun baton is rendered unconscious rather than dead, and will recover any hit points lost to the baton within an hour.

Power Fist,2d6,,6,9,200,-,-,Str,4,2,Punch,"A Power Fist (also known as a Power Glove) is a large metal gauntlet surrounded by an energy field that disrupts solid matter.

While the effects of the temporal alteration are almost imperceptible on a macroscopic scale, the flux of universal constants within sophisticated TL 5 equipment runs a 75% chance of ruining it, while TL 4 equipment suffers a 50% chance of being bricked. The burner is ineffective against devices larger than hand-held equipment, but ignores armor for purposes of determining the AC necessary to hit a character’s equipment.

The projector fires a cone five meters long and five meters wide at its far end, automatically hitting all targets within the area of effect.
